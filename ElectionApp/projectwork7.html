				<h2>Campaigning dos and don’ts</h2>
				<h3>When can you start campaigning?</h3>
				<ol>
					<p>You can start campaigning at any time. You have to wait until you are validly nominated to declare that you will run for election, ask people to support you or publish campaign material.</p>
					<p>Election spending limits apply from the day after the date a person officially becomes a candidate</p>
				</ol>
				<h2>When does a person officially become a candidate?</h2>
				<ol>
					<p>The earliest you can officially become a candidate is on the last date for publishing the notice of election, which is on the 25th working day before the poll. </p>
					<p>You will officially become a candidate on this day if on or before this date you have already declared yourself a candidate at the election (or another person has declared that you are a candidate). </p>
					<p>If after this date you or others declare that you will be a candidate at the election, you will become a candidate on the date such a declaration is made, or on the date that you submit your nomination papers, whichever is the earlier. </p>
					<p> Once you have officially become a candidate, you are entitled to a copy of the electoral register. You are also entitled to a copy of the lists of absent voters for the ward you are standing in. In addition, you can use publicly funded rooms and schools for public meetings </p>
				</ol>
				<h2>During the campaign, you may…</h2>
				<ol>
					<p>Encourage people who are not on the electoral register to apply for registration. The deadline for registering to vote in time for an election is 12 working days before the poll.</p>
					<p>Make sure your supporters follow the Code of conduct for campaigners in Makerere University – this will help them to avoid situations where their honesty or integrity could be questioned</p>
					<p>Make sure your supporters are courteous when dealing with other candidates and their supporters</p>
				</ol>
				<h2>During the campaign, you must not…</h2>
				<ol>
					<p>Knowingly make a false statement about the personal character of a candidate</p>
					<p>Pay canvassers. Canvassing means trying to persuade an elector to vote for or against a particular candidate or party</p>
				</ol>
				<h2>Campaign publicity dos and don’ts</h2>
				<ol>
					<p>Use imprints on all your printed campaign material and any electronic campaign material that is designed to be printed off locally. You should ensure the imprint is clear and visible</p>
					<p>Comply with planning rules relating to advertising hoardings and large banners – you should ask the local authority for advice</p>
					<p>Make sure that outdoor posters are removed promptly after the election – you must do this within two weeks of the election</p>
				</ol>
				<h2>Polling day dos and don’ts</h2>
				<ol>
					<p>Comply with requests by polling station staff or the Returning Officer about campaigning near polling stations. You should, however, be allowed to put your message to voters on polling day, including in public spaces outside polling places.</p>
					<p>You must not campaign near polling stations in a way that could be seen by voters as aggressive or intimidating (for example, large groups of supporters carrying banners, or vehicles with loudspeakers or heavily branded with campaign material). </p>
					<p>Breach the requirements on secrecy of the ballot. This is an essential part of any modern democracy and breaches are taken seriously</p>
					<p>In particular, if you (or your agents) are attending postal vote opening sessions, you must not seek to identify and publicise how votes have been marked on individual ballot papers.</p>
